# Search by Image on Google
This Firefox extension adds an option to the context menu when right-clicking images allowing the user to quickly reverse search for them on Google Images. It is very lightweight and does not require any permissions from the user. It also allows setting whether or not the browser will immediately switch to the newly-opened search tab.
